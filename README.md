  A one stop place to predict chronic diseases related to Heart, Liver, Kidney, etc. and also booking appointments directly if needed with authenticate doctors. Also providing list of common medicines.
  It is very tedious to go through all the tests and pay doctors to check whether you have a disease or not. our app gives you a result with an accuracy of 90+ percent thus saving both time and money. Also with the covid 19 pandaemic going on its too risky to out for pathology /diagnostics test , so you can check it all at your hom sitting in your couch .
